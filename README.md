<b> Hey! I'm @adanmillard (Adan Millard) 👏</b>

I'm a software developer from Auckland, New Zealand.

I've been studying with <b>Mission Ready HQ</b> since May of 2022. Before that I was a Warehouse Manger 💪

I have been studying Full Stack Development, my true passion lies with Front End Development, I like to build UI's in React. 

At the moment most of my time is spent making projects through Mission Ready, I've built projects using, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.JS, Express, MySQL, Mongo DB, React.JS and have learnt CI/CD with Github Actions and Firebase deployment.
